         "Oral and maxillofacial pathology is the specialty of dentistry and the discipline of pathology that addresses the nature, identification and management of diseases affecting the oral and maxillofacial regions.",
         "Surgical Pathology: is that specialty of pathology which deals with the diagnosis of diseases by microscopical examination of tissues taking by a surgeon ((Biopsy)).",
         "Interpreting biopsies is one of the most important duties of the surgical pathologist, having taken a careful history and completed the clinical examination; the clinician is often in a position to formulate the diagnosis, or at least a list of differential diagnosis.",
         "In the latter case, the diagnosis is provisional and another opinion (consultation and referral) or investigation may be necessary to reach a firm diagnosis.",
         "Biopsy is the removal of tissue from a living individual for a diagnosis by histopathological examination.",
         "The use of biopsy is not restricted to the diagnosis of the tumors,but is invaluable in determining the nature of any unusual lesion.' However not all lesions present a specific microscopic appearance and for this reason a definitive diagnosis cannot always be made.",
         "The need for special techniques in surgical pathology is sometimes needed to reach a final diagnosis."

         "· Endoscopic biopsy.",

         "· Surface biopsy.",
         "1-Cautery of these, the one usually least suitable for microscopic interpretation is that obtained with a cautery, because this instrument chars and distorts tissues.",
         "2-Cone biopsy Cone Biopsy removes a piece of tissue which is cylindrical or cone shaped. Cone biopsy is performed to diagnose cervical cancer. Cone biopsy is often done following a pap smear, colposcopy (examination of the cervix under illuminated magnification), and a punch biopsy.",
         "3-Core needle biopsy Core needle biopsy (or core biopsy) is performed by inserting a small hollow needle through the skin and into the organ or abnormality to be investigated. The needle is then advanced within the cell layers to remove a sample or core. Needle biopsy is also a type of percutaneous (through the skin) biopsy. The needle may be designed with a cutting tip to help remove the sample of tissue. Core biopsy is often performed with the use of spring loaded gun to help remove the tissue sample.",
         "4-Vacuum Assisted Biopsy Core biopsy is sometimes suction assisted with a vacuum device. This method enables to removal of multiple samples with only one needle insertion. Vacuum assisted core biopsy is being used more and more in breast biopsy procedures",
         "5-Endoscopic Biopsy Endoscopic biopsy is a very common type of biopsy that is done through an endoscope (a fiber optic cable for viewing inside the body) which is inserted into the body along with sampling instruments.",
         "6-Punch Biopsy Punch biopsy is typically used by dermatologists to sample skin rashes, moles and other small masses. After a local anesthetic is injected,",
         "7-Surface Biopsy Surface biopsy involves sampling or scraping the surface of a sore or tumor to remove cells for pathologic testing. Surface biopsy is often performed by dermatologists to remove a small piece of skin to test for carcinoma (cancerous tissue)."

    {"title": "General rules for the biopsy procedure",
     "content": [
         "1. The larger the lesion, the more numerous the biopsies that should be taken from it because of the variability in pattern that may exist and the fact that the diagnostic areas may be present only focally.",
         "2. In ulcerated tumors, biopsy of the central ulcerated area may show only necrosis and inflammation. The most informative biopsy is likely to be one taken from the periphery that includes both normal and diseased tissue; however, the biopsy should not be so peripheral that only normal tissue is obtained.",
         "3. The biopsy should be deep enough that the relationship between tumor and stroma can be properly assessed. Epithelia involved by carcinoma have a tendency to detach from the underlying stroma. This should be avoided whenever possible by careful handling of the tissue.",
         "4. Deeply seated lesions are sometimes accompanied by a prominent peripheral tissue reaction, which may be characterized by chronic inflammation, hyperemia, fibrosis, calcification, and metaplastic bone formation. If the biopsy is too peripheral, this may be the only tissue obtained. Similarly, in a mass of lymph nodes, a deep-seated node may show involvement by a malignant tumor, whereas a superficial node may show only nonspecific hyperplasia.",
         "5. When several fragments of tissue are obtained, they should all be sent to the pathology department and all of them submitted for microscopic examination. Sometimes the smaller or grossly less impressive fragment is the only one that contains the diagnostic elements.",
         "6. Crushing or squeezing of the tissue with forceps at the time of performance of the biopsy by the surgeon, at the time of the gross examination by the pathologist, or at the time of embedding by the histotechnologist should be carefully avoided. The artifacts resulting from it often render a biopsy impossible to interpret.",
         "7. Once the biopsy is obtained, it should be placed immediately into a container with an adequate volume of fixative. The temptation on the part of the surgeon or the pathologist to turn it around, wash it, or scrape the surface should be resisted, since it will not provide any information of diagnostic significance but only create artifacts.",
         "8. Depending on the presumed or known nature of the lesion, consideration should be given at the time of the biopsy to the possible need for special studies, such as touch preparations, electron microscopy, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, flow cytometry, or others."

         "The decision whether to perform an incisional or an excisional biopsy depends primarily on the size of the lesion; the smaller it is, the more logical to take it out completely when first encountered.",
         "For large lesions, particularly those of deep soft tissues, an incisional biopsy is usually preferable because of the fact that the type and extent of excision vary considerably depending on the tumor type."

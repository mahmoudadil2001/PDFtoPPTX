         "The most significant diagnostic problem that the dentists may face in their practice is to determine the extent of the pulp disease that has taken place within a symptomatic (painful) tooth.",
         "An evaluation of the damage to the pulpal tissue is essential, since the pulp can neither be seen nor touched, an indirect assessment is required.",
         "Inflammation is the single most important disease process affecting the dental pulp and accounts for virtually all pulpal diseases of any clinical significance.",
         "The decision to be made by the dentist based on clinical assessment of the pattern of pulp inflammation (pulpitis) is one of three :-",
         "1- To restore the defective tooth structure ((conservative)).",
         "2- To remove the pulp tissue ((endodontic)).",
         "3- To remove the entire tooth.",
         "In making such a decision, the clinician should decide whether the pulp damage ((pulpitis)) is reversible or irreversible pulpitis."

     "content": [
         "The dental pulp is a delicate connective tissue, containing tiny blood vessels, lymphatic, myelinated, unmyelinated nerves, and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells like other connective tissues throughout the body; it reacts to noxious stimuli by an inflammatory response.",
         "This response is not significantly different from that seen in other tissues, the final result can be different because of certain peculiar (anatomical) features of the pulp which includes :-",
         "1-the pulp is enclosed within the calcified walls of the dentin, which precludes the excessive swelling of the tissue that occurs in hyperemic and edematous phases of inflammation in other tissues.",
         "2-the blood vessels supplying the pulp tissues must enter the tooth through a tiny apical foramen, this precludes the development of an extensive collateral blood supply to the inflamed part."

         "Heat generation, depth of preparation, dehydration of tubules, pulp exposure, and volatile/toxic disinfectant filling materials.",
         "Of these causes, the bacterial effects are the most important.",

         "Dental pain has been described by air crew flying at high altitudes in unpressurized aircraft.",
         "And in divers subjected to too rapid decompression following deep sea diving.",
         "This pain has been attributed to the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the pulp tissues or vessels, similar to the decompression syndrome elsewhere in the body, however, gas bubbles are seldom found in decompressed organs and the possibility of fat emboli from altered lipoproteins and platelet thrombi around the fat is suggested by some investigators.",
         "Aerodontalgia is really a marker of inadequate pulp protection from the atmosphere and this usually means caries.",
         "It is not a direct cause of pulpitis, rather an exacerbating factor."

         "The best classification system is one that guides the appropriate treatment ((1 of the 3 choices))",
         "Reversible pulpitis denotes a level of pulpal inflammation in which the tissue is capable of returning to a normal state of health if the noxious stimuli are removed.",
         "Irreversible pulpitis implies that a higher level of inflammation has developed in which the dental pulp has been damaged beyond the point of recovery"

    {"title": "Pulpal Inflammation Mechanism",
     "content": [
         "When external stimuli reach a noxious level, degranulation of mast cells, decreased nutrient flow and cellular damage occur.",
         "Numerous inflammatory mediators (histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins) are released.",
         "These mediators cause vasodilation, increased blood flow, and vascular leakage with edema.",
         "Normally this should promote healing through removal of inflammatory mediators.",
         "However, the dental pulp exists in a very confined area.",
         "If the inflammatory process continued for an extended period of time can lead to increased pulp injury or even death of the pulp.",
         "Previous studies suggested that the associated increased vascular pulpal pressures could compress venous return and lead to (self-strangulation) and pulp necrosis.",
         "Recent studies recognize that the increased fluid pressure usually is localized to the area of inflamed pulp immediately adjacent to the affected dentin, increased interstitial pressure in area of inflammation leads to increased flow of fluid back into capillaries of adjacent uninflammed tissue and increased drainage.",
         "In this manner, the increased fluid pressure from inflammation is counteracted and typically does not lead to generalized increase in pulp fluid pressure, effectively preventing (self-strangulation).",
         "According to the above mentioned explanation of the pulp response to injury, it seems that the pulp defense mechanisms may work well with many mild-moderate injuries and rarely result in widespread necrosis.",
         "Localized pulp abscesses may heal after eliminating the injury and formation of reparative dentin, however sever localized pulpal damage can overwhelm the system, leading to pulp necrosis."

         "Tertiary dentin may be noted in the adjacent wall.",
         "On clinical examination the pain is mild-moderate in intensity and responds to sudden change in temperature.",

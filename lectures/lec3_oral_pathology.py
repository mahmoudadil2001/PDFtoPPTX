     "content": [
         "Dental caries is a multifaceted disease involving interplay among the teeth, the oral host factor of saliva and microflora, and the external factor (diet).",
         "It is a unique form of infection in which specific strains of bacteria accumulate on the enamel surface, where they elaborate acidic and proteolytic products that demineralize the surface and digest (destruct) its organic matrix."

    {"title": "Epidemiology of Dental Caries",
     "content": [
         "Dental caries has been recognized throughout history and exists around the world, although the prevalence and severity varies in different populations.",
         "In western industry countries there was a sharp increase in disease activity in the first half of the twentieth century, because industry countries had diet with a higher content of refined carbohydrates than less-developed countries.",
         "During the 1970s and 1980s the prevalence of dental caries in children fell steadily, particularly following the widespread use of fluoride-containing toothpastes and greater access to dental care.",
         "Despite the encouraging and sustained reduction in dental caries in industrialized countries, the prevalence is increasing in certain developing countries and is associated with urbanization and the increased availability of refined carbohydrates."

    {"title": "Theories of Dental Caries",
     "content": [
         "1- Acidogenic theory (chemo parasitic theory): Proposes that acid formed from fermentation of dietary carbohydrates by oral bacteria leads to progressive decalcification of tooth substance (inorganic) with subsequent disintegration of the organic matrix.",
         "Evidence: Experimental studies by Orland and his workers in 1954 showed that germ-free oral hygiene animals did not develop dental caries even with sugar administration.",
         "2- Proteolytic theory: Suggests microorganisms attack the organic part of enamel, leaving acid to further decalcify the inorganic part.",
         "Objection: Out of 0.56% organic matrix, 0.18% is keratin, and no enzyme systems capable of attacking keratin have been isolated.",
         "3- Proteolysis-chelating theory (Schatz et al 1955): Products of proteolysis act as chelating agents to remove calcium ions from tooth by forming complexes, possibly at neutral pH.",
         "Objection: Saliva and plaque do not contain sufficient concentrations to chelate calcium from enamel; chelators more likely bind calcium from saliva.",
         "4- Sucrose-chelating theory (Eggers-Lura 1948): Sucrose acts as a chelating agent forming calcium saccharide, removing calcium from enamel.",
         "Objection: Sucrose is rapidly metabolized to acid and polysaccharides, not present long enough to form chelate."

         "6- Once the dentine has been reached, pioneer bacteria extend down the tubule, soon fill them and spread along any lateral branches. The tubules become distended into spindle shapes by the expanding masses of bacteria and their product, as a result, adjacent tubules which are less heavily infected become bent, later the intervening tubule walls are destroyed and collections of bacteria in adjacent tubules coalesce to form irregular liquefaction foci. These are ovoid areas of dentinal destruction and it is parallel to the direction of dentinal tubule. It is filled with necrotic debris which increases gradually in size by expansion; in some areas, bacteria also spread laterally and occasionally large bacteria-filled clefts formed at right angles to the tubules. Clinically, these clefts may allow carious dentin to be excavated easily."
